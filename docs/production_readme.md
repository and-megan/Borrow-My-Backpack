[Borrow My Backpack live][heroku] **NB:** This will be a link to BorrowMyBackpack

[heroku]: http://www.herokuapp.com

Borrow My Backpack is a web application inspired by CouchSurfing. Borrow My Backpack is built using Ruby on Rails and React.js.

Borrow My Backpack allows users to share sports equipment. Lenders can post their equipment, such as backpacks and kayaks. Borrowers search through listed equipment and send requests with specific dates to the lender. Lenders can accept or reject borrower requests. Borrow My Backpack could connect people with outdoor adventures without necessitating large purchases. This app was not built for commercial purposes, but rather to showcase the skills of the developer.
